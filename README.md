# Why We Use JSDoc Instead of TypeScript

We use JSDoc to keep our codebase simple, fast, and easy to maintain.

Our focus:

- ⚙️ Minimal tooling
- ⚡ Fast dev cycles
- ✨ Clean, flexible JS
- 🧩 Native compatibility
- 👋 Easy onboarding
- 🚫 No build steps or lock-in

TypeScript adds complexity—build systems, strict rules, and heavy tooling. It slows down dev and forces tradeoffs we don't need.

With JSDoc + `@ts-check`, `tsc --noEmit`, and ESLint, we get strong type checking and editor support—without the overhead.

## JSDoc vs TypeScript

| Feature                 | JSDoc (`@ts-check`)  | TypeScript (`.ts`)       |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Compile step           | None                 | Required                 |
| Tooling complexity     | Low                  | High                     |
| Runtime compatibility  | Native JS            | Needs transpilation      |
| Editor support         | Full                 | Full                     |
| Incremental adoption   | Per-file             | Whole project            |
| Build artifacts        | None                 | `.js`, `.d.ts`, `.map`   |
| External types         | Optional             | Required                 |
| Dynamic code support   | Native               | Limited                  |
| Readability            | Unchanged            | Often reduced            |
| Ecosystem lock-in      | None                 | High                     |

## Why JSDoc Works Better for Us

### 1. Native Workflow
- Run `.js` directly
- No output files

### 2. Minimal Setup
- No compiler, no new syntax

### 3. Full JS Compatibility
- Works with dynamic/runtime/metaprogramming

### 4. Selective Typing
- Use `@ts-check` where needed

### 5. Full Editor Support
- Autocomplete, tooltips, jump-to-def

### 6. Low Maintenance
- Fewer type updates, no rewrites

### 7. Fast Dev
- No compile delays, fewer false errors

### 8. Lint-Ready
- Works with ESLint, Prettier, `eslint-plugin-jsdoc`

### 9. No `@types` Overhead
- Optional use only

### 10. Cleaner Code
- Prefer simple functions and primitives

## What We Avoid

- Build clutter
- Slower workflows
- Fragile types
- Breaking updates
- Type package churn
- Limited dynamic support
- Non-standard syntax
- Long-term type debt

## TypeScript: Tradeoffs

JSDoc is slightly more verbose but avoids rare, complex features like conditional and mapped types. Covers 90% of real-world needs.

## Best Use Cases for JSDoc

- API definitions
- Utility functions
- DB schemas
- Plugin/middleware interfaces
- Dynamic or mixed JS projects

## Final Take

JSDoc gives us type safety, clarity, and tooling—without TypeScript's cost. Ideal for fast, flexible, native JavaScript workflows.
